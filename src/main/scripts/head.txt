Writable is an interface i Hadoop. It acts as wrapper to primitive data type of Java. 
All the Mapreduce datatypes must implement WritableComparable interface

Java Primitive 	
Boolean  BooleanWritable (BooleanWritable is a class implements WritableComparable interface)
Byte ByteWriteable
Short ShortWritable
Int IntWritable
Float FloatWritable
Long LongWritable
Double DoubleWritable

String Text
Object ObjectWritable

User defined PojoWritable implement Comparable Interface

Writable interface Can be used as only Values (Because values do need to be compared)
WritableComparable Can be used as both keys and values (Because keys need to be compared in partition and shuffling stage)

public interface Writable{
	void redFields(DataInput in);
	void write(DataOutput out);
}

public interface WritableComparable{
	void redFields(DataInput in);
	void write(DataOutput out);
	int compareTo(WritableComparable o);
}

Transformation needs Serialization
